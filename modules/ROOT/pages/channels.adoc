There is an extensive (but incomplete) IRCnet channel list at https://www.ircnet.info/channels

See our xref:faq.adoc[FAQ] about `/LIST` and xref:alis.adoc[Alis].

If you are looking for the channel of a project, as for example found on sourceforge.net and can't find such channel on IRCnet, try looking for #nameoftheproject on the irc://irc.freenode.net or irc://irc.oftc.net IRC servers.

There is also a big gaming community on irc://irc.quakenet.org.

Not a channel or a network, but http://irc.netsplit.de/ lists networks, servers and channels, worth a look. The same goes for http://searchirc.com (IRCnet section at http://searchirc.com/network/IRCNet)
